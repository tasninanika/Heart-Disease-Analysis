## ðŸ“œ Project Overview

The Heart Disease Analysis project is a comprehensive machine learning study aimed at predicting the presence of heart disease using the Heart Disease UCI Dataset. Implemented in a Jupyter Notebook (heart-disease-analysis.ipynb), this project covers data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature selection, model training, evaluation, and advanced interpretability techniques. It also includes unsupervised learning with Self-Organizing Maps (SOM) for clustering and visualization.
The project employs multiple classifiers (Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, K-Nearest Neighbors) and uses techniques like SMOTE for handling class imbalance. Additionally, it integrates interpretability tools (SHAP, LIME) to explain model predictions and geographical visualization with Folium for contextual analysis.

## ðŸš€ Features

### Data Preprocessing:

* Loads the dataset from heart.csv.
* Handles categorical variables and missing values.
* Applies SMOTE to address class imbalance.

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

* Summarizes dataset characteristics (e.g., data types, missing values).
* Visualizes feature distributions and correlations.

### Feature Selection:

* Uses mutual information to identify important features.

### Model Training:

* Implements Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN).
* Uses stratified k-fold cross-validation for robust evaluation.

### Model Evaluation:

* Evaluates models using accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report.

### Model Interpretability:

* Applies SHAP and LIME for explaining model predictions.

### Clustering:

* Uses MiniSom for Self-Organizing Maps to cluster data and visualize patterns.

### Geographical Visualization:

* Integrates Folium and Geopy for mapping hypothetical patient locations.

## ðŸ“Š Dataset

The dataset used is the Heart Disease UCI Dataset, containing medical records for heart disease prediction. Key details:

* **Source**: Loaded from heart.csv.

* **Size**: 918 samples, 12 columns.

* **Features**:

  * Age: Patient's age (integer).
  * Sex: Gender (M/F, object).
  * ChestPainType: Type of chest pain (object).
  * RestingBP: Resting blood pressure (integer).
  * Cholesterol: Cholesterol level (integer).
  * FastingBS: Fasting blood sugar (0/1, integer).
  * RestingECG: Resting ECG results (object).
  * MaxHR: Maximum heart rate (integer).
  * ExerciseAngina: Exercise-induced angina (Y/N, object).
  * Oldpeak: ST depression (float).
  * ST\_Slope: Slope of the peak exercise ST segment (object).
  * HeartDisease: Target variable (0 = No disease, 1 = Disease, integer).

* **No Missing Values**: The dataset is clean, with no null values.

### Clustering

A 5x5 Self-Organizing Map (SOM) is used to cluster the data, visualized as a grid showing cluster assignments for samples.

### Interpretability

* **SHAP**: Provides feature importance and contribution to predictions.
* **LIME**: Explains individual predictions with local feature importance.

### Visualizations

* Correlation heatmaps and feature distribution plots for EDA.
* SOM grid for clustering visualization.
* Geographical maps using Folium for hypothetical patient location analysis.
